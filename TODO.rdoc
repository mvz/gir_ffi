== Separate bindings to GIRepository from dynamic binding generation.

== Remove code for passing generic pointers

Generic pointers have been declared 'not introspectable', so
handling them can be removed.

== Handle fundamental objects that are not GObject.

This is a big one. See commit 1e9822c7817062a9b853269b9418fd78782090b5 in
gobject-introspection, and TestFundamentalObject in Regress.

== Check binding of GObject:

(11:37:03 PM) walters: the basic story is that GObject should be manually bound
(11:47:02 PM) ebassi: the really necessary bits are: GObject/GInitiallyUnowned memory management; properties accessors; GSignal connection API
(11:47:15 PM) ebassi: the rest is "nice to have"
(11:47:37 PM) ebassi: oh, and probably GBinding - but that's just because I wrote it ;-)

== Compatibility with all implementations.

Currently, there are the following incompatibilities:

* JRuby disables ObjectSpace by default, so using _id2ref for handling the
  passing of generic pointers is not ideal.
